# Daily LeetCode AI Solver

This project automatically solves the daily LeetCode problem using AI and commits the solution to this repository.

## How it works

1. **GitHub Actions Workflow**: Runs daily at midnight UTC
2. **Fetches Daily Problem**: Gets the LeetCode daily challenge
3. **AI Solution**: Uses OpenAI to generate a solution
4. **Auto-Commit**: Saves and commits the solution to the `solutions/` directory

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- GitHub repository
- OpenAI API key (or other AI service)

### Configuration

1. Add your OpenAI API key as a GitHub Secret:
   - Go to your repository Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
   - Add a new secret named `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your API key

2. The workflow will run automatically every day at midnight UTC
   - You can also trigger it manually from the Actions tab
